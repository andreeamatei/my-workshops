# Front End Basics
Creating the famous TODO app.

## Target group
This workshop is addressed to people that already know basic programming concepts (at least: variables, functions, selection and repetition structures), but never worked on Front-End Web.


## Objectives

* Know which are the three pillars of front-end web dev - HTML, CSS and JS - and understand what they are used for and how they are related to each other.
* Use basic HTML tags to define the structure of a web app.
* Use JS to add some functionality to your app.
* Learn how to store data in the browser.

## Steps

1. Create an HTML file and its basic structure.
2. Create a JS file and link it in the HTML.
3. Start thinking about the elements that you need on the page. Add these elements in HTML.
   * a heading - "My TODO list"
   * a container for the list of todos
   * an add (+) button
   * a form that handles the addition of one todo: clicking the + button triggers the display of a text input and a "Save" button. Take into account user experience (hide the + button when the form is displayed).
4. Now that the form is in place, start implementing the functionality of adding a todo. Keep it as simple as possible, for now:
   * The user enters some data in the text input
   * Upon clicking "Save"
      * that text is displayed inside the todo list container
      * the form is hidden
